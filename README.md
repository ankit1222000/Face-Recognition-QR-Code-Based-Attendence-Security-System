- Students punch their attendence using QR Code on their ID Cards over the inbuilt application webcam QR scanner.

- Before punching the attendence they need to scan their face onto the webcam/camera to ensure they are the same as they are labelled to be for the case of security.


- On sucessfull punching their QR Code, attendence will be punched and a Message will be sent to their guardians on their safe arrival in school


- Functionality for Admin /School

			* Creation of daily attendence report,complete student record,and monthy attendence record of each child.

			* Sending SMS to absent as well as present students(and how much late they are to school) to their guardian mobile number
